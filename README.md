# Face-Recognition, Back-End 

Face-Recognition is an application that through Clarifai's Face-recognition-API, gives you the possibility to find the face on images.

For the server of the web-app I used Node.js with Express.js.

For the Database, I used PostgreSql and DBeaver which is a SQL client software application and a database management tool.
